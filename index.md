I am an astronomy graduate student working with Professor Dave Sanders at the Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawai'i Manoa. My research intrests mainly focus on galaxy evolution and the role that active galactic nuclei (AGN) play in this evolution. I am a key member of the Accretion History of AGN collaboration working on studying the evolution of active galaxies across cosmic time utilizing large X-ray surveys. 

## Current Research Interests:
- AGN feedback and evolution
- Mass measurements of SMBHs
- Modeling spectral energy distributions
- AGN emission in luminous IR galaxies

## Current Collaborations:
- The Accretion History of AGN (AHA) collaboration
- The COSMOS-Web Program

## Career Interests:
- I am currently interested in postdoc positions in Astronomy. If you are hiring and believe that I would be a good fit for a positions, please let me know.
