I am a new postdoctoral researcher working with Dr. Mike Koss at Eureka Scientific Inc. My research intrests mainly focus on galaxy evolution and the role that active galactic nuclei (AGN) play in this evolution. I am also a key member of both the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS) collaboration and the Accretion History of AGN collaboration working on studying the evolution of active galaxies across cosmic time utilizing large X-ray surveys. 

## Current Research Interests:
- AGN feedback and evolution
- Mass measurements of SMBHs
- Modeling spectral energy distributions
- AGN emission in luminous IR galaxies

## Current Collaborations:
- The BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS) collaboration
- The Accretion History of AGN (AHA) collaboration
- The COSMOS-Web Program

## Career Interests:
- I am currently interested in future postdoc positions in Astronomy studing AGN and galaxy evolution. If you are hiring and believe that I would be a good fit for a positions, please let me know.
