I am an astronomy graduate student working with Professor Dave Sanders at the Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawai'i Manoa. My research intrests mainly focus on galaxy evolution and the role that active galactic nuclei (AGN) play in this evolution. I am a key member of the Accretion History of AGN collaboration working on studying the evolution of active galaxies across cosmic time utilizing large X-ray surveys.
