title: About Me

## Background
My name is Connor Auge and while I was born in Illinois, I grew up in southern California. While I was an active child, involved in many different sports throughout my childhood, I have always had a fascination with math and science, finding a particularly strong interest in space. Many of the teachers I had when I was young helped to bolster this interest in science, encouraging me to pursue a career in STEM. This lead me to enroll in the physics and astronomy department at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff for my undergraduate degree. 

While furthering my education at NAU I also began my first research project studying interacting galaxy systems with Dr. Lisa Chien. Dr. Chien and a massive influence on my educational path in giving me this research opportunity and providing me with the support I needed to be successful both as a student and as a new researcher. With her support I was able to continue my education and enroll at the University of Hawaii to pursue my doctorate degree in Astronomy. 

At UH I was able to branch out in my research experience beyond the extragalactic work I conducted at NAU and work with Dr. Dan Huber on a project that proved the feasibility of conducting asteroseismology studies on Red Giants using ground based transient surveys. While, it was an amazing experience working with Dr. Huber on this project, I decided to return to extragalactic research for my dissertation work. I began working with Dr. Dave Sanders and the Accretion History of AGN collaboration to study the multiwavelength properties of active galactic nuclei and how they evolve over cosmic time. Since then I have continued to work on projects focusing on AGN and galaxy evolution. I hope to continue similar research throughout the rest of my career in academia. 

## Other Interests 
Outside of astronomy, I like to remain active. I frequently go on hikes, exploring the wonderful beauty that can be found across the island of Oahu. I also enjoy long distance running and completed my first marathon in 2021. If I am not working, running, or hiking, you can probably find me playing board games with friends or trying any new restaurants or coffee shops that I can find around town.
