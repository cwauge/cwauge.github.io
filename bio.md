## Background
My name is Connor Auge and while I was born in Illinois, I grew up in southern California. While I was an active child, involved in many different sports throughout my childhood, I have always had a fascination with math and science, finding a particularly strong interest in space. Many of the teachers I had when I was young helped to bolster this interest in science, encouraging me to pursue a career in STEM. This lead me to enroll in the physics and astronomy department at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff for my undergraduate degree.
