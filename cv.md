## Currently

Graduate Student at the Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii Manoa

## Education

`2013 - 2017`
__Northern Arizona University__
BS in Physics and Astronommy with a minor in Mathematics

`2017 - 2019`
__University of Hawaii__
MS in Astronomy 

`2019 - 2023`
__University of Hawaii__
Anticipated Ph.D in Astronomy 

## Research Experience
`August 2018 - Present`
__University of Hawaii - Research Assistant to Dr. Dave Sanders__
Conducted research to analyze the multiwavelength properties of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Generated Python software to produce spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and derive fundamental parameters of AGN and their host galaxies. Utilized advance SED fitting software, CIGALE, to fit physical models to multiwavelength data. Conducted extensive research with the Accretion History of AGN (AHA) collaboration.


`December 2017 - January 2020`
__University of Hawaii - Research Assistant to Dr. Dan Huber__
Developed Python code to analyze light curves from ground-based, all-sky, transient surveys and determine asteroseismic parameters for evolved red giant stars. Established the ground work for a novel, new method to determine precise distances to hundreds of thousands of evolved stars beyond the reach of the Gaia spacecraft. 

`January 2015 - May 2017`
__Northern Arizona University - Research Assistant to Dr. Lisa Chien__
Mapped the neutral hydrogen gas distributions in an ensemble of interacting galaxy systems and modeled the gas dynamics of individual systems to generate a detailed history of the galaxy interaction.

`January 2016 - May 2017`
__Northern Arizona University - Research Assistant to Dr. Michael Mommert__
Derived photometric filter transformations utilizing large stellar catalogs for implementation in a open-source Python package.

## Mentoring/Advising Expereince
`Summer 2022`
__University of Hawaii - Thresa Kelly__
Undergraduate, University of Kansas. - IfA REU Program

I designed the research project and served as the primary mentor and advisor for Thresa Kelly during her time in the IfA REU program. The project focused on comparing the multiwavelength properties of AGN that have been selected through varying techniques.

`Summer 2022`
__University of Hawaii - Aurelie Wolf}__
Undergraduate University of Hawai'i Manoa. - Summer Research Project 

I assisted in advising and mentoring Aurelie Wolf as she completed a summer research project. The project consisted of the visual classification of galaxy images to identify signs of mergers in AGN hosts.

`Summer 2021 and Summer 2023`
__University of Hawaii - William Jarvis__
Undergraduate, University of Wisconsin, Madison. - IfA REU Program

I designed the research project and served as the primary mentor and advisor for William Jarvis during his time in the IfA REU program. The project focused on visually classifying the host galaxies of AGN and analyzing the multiwavelength properties to constrain the evolutionary phase of the AGN.

`Summer 2019`
__University of Hawaii - Kaitlynn Lilly__
Undergraduate, University of Maryland, Baltimore County. - IfA REU Program

I served as the primary mentor and advisor for Kaitlynn Lilly during her time in the IfA REU program. The project focused on characterizing the SEDs and of X-ray selected AGN by their spectral type.
